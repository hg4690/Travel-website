<h2>Amsterdam</h2>

<p> With its criss-cross of picturesque streets, beautiful canals, historic buildings and warm atmosphere, Amsterdam is by far my favourite European city. Top attractions include scenic boat trips, The Cheese Museum (eat your weight in free samples) and the poignant Anne Frank House Museum. My favourite thing about the city is that you can walk easily around the main areas and enjoy the ambiance without requiring masses of transport and a pre planned itinerary. <br ?>

<strong>TOP TIPS<strong> <br />
Book in advance for the Anne Frank House as the queue begins over an hour before arrival, and if you're there after 10am will usually take three hours. <br />
Be aware of light fingered individuals in crowds, especially if you venture into the red light district. <br />
If you're staying in a hostel, choose carefully which one. A lot of people come to amsterdam to party, so if you're there for the cultural sights bear that in mind. Shelter Hostels offer a good, slightly quieter, alternative and whilst they are christian run, cater to any religion. </p>
