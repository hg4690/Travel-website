<center> <h1>A guide to Amsterdam</h1>


<p class="custom"> Amsterdam is perhaps my <strong>favourite</strong> ity that I have visited. <br />
It has a uniqiue charm with beauiful architecture, parks and history. As a lover of waterfront cities, the stunning canal network and harbour cement the city as a firm favourite. <br />

 With its criss-cross of picturesque streets, quaint bridges, historic buildings and warm atmosphere, you can walk easily around the main areas and enjoy the ambiance without requiring masses of transport and a pre planned itinerary. Some top attractions include scenic boat trips, The Cheese Museum (eat your weight in free samples) and the poignant Anne Frank House Museum.  <br /> <br /> <br />  </p>

<strong>TOP TIPS<strong /> <br /></centre >
Book in advance for the Anne Frank House as the queue begins over an hour before arrival, and if you're there after 10am will usually take three hours. The queue above (left) had already formed before the Museum opened. <br /> <br />
Be aware of light fingered individuals in crowds, especially if you venture into the red light district. <br /> <br />
If you're staying in a hostel, choose carefully which one. A lot of people come to amsterdam to party, so if you're there for the cultural sights bear that in mind. Shelter Hostels offer a good, slightly quieter, alternative and whilst they are christian run, cater to any religion. <br /> <br />
Remember to be alert for trams and cars, mopeds and bicycles also tend to drive on the pavement! </p>
